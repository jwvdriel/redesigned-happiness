very basic book library in which you can add books into your library

You can submit your books through the form on the html page which will display the corresponding books you have added, when you have read the book you can cross it of your list by clicking the corresponding button and even remove the book from your library if wanted or things get cluttered,

there is no storage what so ever in a database or through local storage which can be added later.
