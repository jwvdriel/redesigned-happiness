Very basic book library in which you can add books into your library

You can submit your books through the form on the html page which will display the corresponding books you have added, when you have read the book you can cross it of your list by clicking the corresponding button.

If clicked on the button the text will change to a read state or not read state depending wether the book has been read or not.

There is no storage what so ever in a database or through local storage which can be added later.
